h1. Reddit logo generator

This generates a SVG image that has a orangered envelope when you've got mail. 

I use is to illustrate the shortcut to Reddit in the Google Chrome extention Speed Dial 2 (http://speeddial2.com )

Makes use of the Reddit PHP SDK :https://github.com/jcleblanc/reddit-php-sdk

h2. Initiating Your Login Session

Before making requests to any of the methods of the Reddit SDK, you first need to authenticate by calling the login method with your username and password.  This will populate your user hash and session data.
<notextile>
<pre>
$reddit = new reddit("USERNAME", "PASSWORD");
</pre>
</notextile>

See if I have any mail waiting for me at http://veradekok.nl/New%20Tab%20progsels/reddit-logo.php

If I were to have mail, the image would look like this: http://veradekok.nl/New%20Tab%20progsels/mail_reddit_logo.svg
