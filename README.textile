h1. Reddit logo generator

Makes use of the Reddit PHP SDK :https://github.com/jcleblanc/reddit-php-sdk

h2. Initiating Your Login Session

Before making requests to any of the methods of the Reddit SDK, you first need to authenticate by calling the login method with your username and password.  This will populate your user hash and session data.
<notextile>
<pre>
$reddit = new reddit("USERNAME", "PASSWORD");
</pre>
</notextile>
